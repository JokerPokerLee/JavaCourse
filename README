Homework 2: Linklist

Homework 3: FileViewer

    A simple app for viewing the hierarchy of the file system. Meanwhile, it
    provide details of the file or directory whichever you click.

    The app use the top most directory of the partition as default root of
    the hierarchy tree. User can also specify the path and pass it as  a
    parameter when refer the app.

    Due to the limited memory space, the maximum number of files is set as
    150000 and the maximum of the depth of the tree is set as 10.

    It can work well on both Linux and Windows.
